# Accessible Interactions with the Flamegraph

When initially loading the `.svg` file into a browser, you will need to hit the `Tab` key to focus on the first item.

Afterwards, your key combinations are as follows:

- `Up`: go to first child of current node (if any)
- `Down`: go to parent
- `Left`: go to earlier sibling
- `Right`: go to next sibling
- `Enter`: use current node as root
    - NOTE: visually, when this action is performed, the width of the bars becomes relative to the width of the current node. _However_, the screen reader will still read out absolute percentages and sample amounts. This is to-be-completed functionality.

When using a screen reader, you should hear the text of the node in this format: `"function_name (N samples, M percent)"`

The percentage indicates the global amount of samples taken within that function.
